## Example Use Case

A development team working on a new microservices project can use ClrSlate’s application blueprints to quickly set up their development environment. They choose the Node.js blueprint, which includes Express.js and necessary dependencies. The integrated CI/CD pipeline automates the build and deployment process, while pre-configured Grafana dashboards provide real-time monitoring. Security scans with Trivy and KubeClarity ensure the application is secure before it goes live.
