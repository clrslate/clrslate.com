# Secrets Management

## Overview

ClrSlate provides robust secrets management capabilities, ensuring that sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, and tokens are stored securely and accessed safely. The integration of tools like External Secrets Operator and Sealed Secrets enhances the security posture of Kubernetes environments by managing secrets efficiently and securely.

## Key Features

### External Secrets Operator
- **Integration with Secret Stores:** Synchronizes secrets from external secret stores such as AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, and Google Cloud Secret Manager into Kubernetes.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Automatically updates secrets in Kubernetes when they change in the external secret store, ensuring that applications always use the latest credentials.
- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):** Uses Kubernetes CRDs to manage and configure external secrets, making it easy to define which secrets to pull and how to store them in Kubernetes.

### Sealed Secrets
- **Encryption of Secrets:** Encrypts Kubernetes secrets before they are committed to source control, ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed.
- **Public Key Encryption:** Uses a public/private key pair to encrypt and decrypt secrets, allowing only authorized users to view the plain text values.
- **Sealed Secret Controller:** Runs as a controller in the Kubernetes cluster, decrypting sealed secrets at runtime and converting them into regular Kubernetes secrets.

### Access Controls
- **RBAC:** Implements Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to restrict access to secrets, ensuring that only authorized personnel can view or modify sensitive data.
- **IAM Policies:** Uses IAM policies for external secret stores to control who can access and manage secrets, providing an additional layer of security.

### Audit and Compliance
- **Audit Logs:** Maintains detailed logs of all secret access and modifications, helping organizations track who accessed or changed secrets and when.
- **Compliance Reporting:** Generates reports to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2, ensuring that secret management practices meet industry standards.

### Ease of Use
- **Configuration Management:** Simplifies the configuration of secrets management through Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts, making it easy to deploy and manage.
- **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines:** Seamlessly integrates with CI/CD pipelines, allowing secrets to be managed as part of the deployment process without exposing sensitive data.
