## Example Use Case

A financial services company uses ClrSlate to manage their Kubernetes clusters. They configure Velero to perform scheduled backups every night and incremental backups throughout the day. In the event of a failure, they can quickly restore critical applications and data, minimizing downtime. The encrypted backups are stored in AWS S3, and access controls ensure that only authorized personnel can initiate backup and recovery operations. Regular integrity checks and test restorations give the company confidence in their disaster recovery plan.
