# Multi-Tenancy and Cost Accountability

## Overview

ClrSlate supports multi-tenancy, enabling organizations to efficiently manage multiple teams, departments, or projects within a single platform. Additionally, it provides robust cost management features to ensure that resources are used efficiently and costs are tracked accurately.

## Key Features

- **Cluster-Based Isolation:** Supports running multiple Kubernetes clusters for complete isolation between tenants, enhancing security and resource management.
- **Resource Quotas:** Allows setting resource quotas for each tenant to control and limit resource usage, preventing any single tenant from monopolizing resources.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Granular Permissions:** Provides fine-grained control over who can access what resources, ensuring that users only have the permissions they need.
- **SSO Integration with KeyCloak:** Simplifies user management by integrating with KeyCloak for single sign-on (SSO) and centralized authentication.

### Dashboards and Visualization
- **Cost Dashboards:** Interactive dashboards that provide a visual representation of resource usage and costs, helping stakeholders understand and manage their cloud expenditures.
- **Trend Analysis:** Tracks cost trends over time, enabling organizations to identify patterns and optimize resource allocation and budgeting.

### Compliance and Governance

## Example Use Case

A software development company can use ClrSlate to manage multiple development teams working on different projects. Each team has its own namespace or cluster, ensuring isolation and security. Automated tagging and detailed cost reports allow the company to track expenses for each project, enabling accurate budgeting and cost optimization. RBAC ensures that team members have the appropriate access permissions, and compliance policies are enforced across all environments.
